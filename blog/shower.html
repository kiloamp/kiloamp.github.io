          I've always loved long showers. I think it's because I grew up in a doors-always-open policy household and that made having moments alone all that more difficult.

          Apart from the <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/033/758/Screen_Shot_2020-04-28_at_12.21.48_PM.png" target="_blank">obvious benefits</a> of a teenager having privacy, at some point (9? 11? 14? unsure of the age) you learn a bit about life: suddenly you can have your own opinions, your own schedules, ... You are no longer a headless blob following parental/guardian's orders.

          A long shower to me meant having time alone, not having to listen to TV blasting from the other room when I try to think, the shower's curtain acted as a a real curtain from everything else. You can sit there, and think, it's really cool.

          Anyways! Sorry for the long story
