      <h3>Me, as a person</h3>
      <article>
        Hello, I'm Carlos. <br>
        I am 21 (21, wow) and I'm just about to finish uni. <br>
        I am from Spain, I moved to the UK for college. <br>

      <h3>Me, as a concept</h3>
      <article>
        💻 I am crazy about Computer Science; <br>
        I love the way hardware and software join and the creative aspect of it. I also think it is madly social. You can just sit with some friends and literally redefine anything, disrupt any industry. You can have fun with it, use it to extend other jobs, practise with it... it's just great.<br> <br>
        👨‍✈️ I also love aviation; <br>
        It's such a good mix of nature and physics, of the complexity of putting something in the air and the simplicity of looking at the clouds and feeling like your are flying. Ideally soon I will be developing my knowledge in the field and trying to get a job in it (to some extend).

      <h3> Me, as a hobbyst</h3>
      <article>
        ⚽ As a sport, I think football is great; <br>
        I don't think I enjoy any other sport more. It's just so easy to start playing with anyone - no language needed. You can play just you to literally tens of people. It trains endurance, strength, balance but also the brain, imagination and social skills.  <br><br>

        🏎️ Motorsport, what a combination; <br>
        Motorsport in a way is like avation, compsci and football together. You are part of a team
