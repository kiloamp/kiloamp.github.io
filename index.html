      My name is Carlos and I'm 21. Even though I was born in Barcelona, I moved to Palma de Mallorca at young age.<br>

      Since people close to me were commercial pilots I've always felt at home with aviation. At around 15 or so I also started enjoying the computer-science-ey side of planes; avionics.

      Shortly after I moved to the UK for college, one of the best things I've done. Not only did I improve my english and learn about a new culture, but I went through an incredible journey of self-discovery and made some great friends along the way.

      In college I got into Linux, ThinkPads (and how cool toying with computers is) and Python, which I used on my Computer Science Project; making a <a href="coursework.pdf" target="_blank">2D Air traffic Control game</a> (it was a bit of a trash project, but a really cool experience).

      For my last year of college I also did an Extended Project Qualification. I did mine on the <a href="epq.pdf" target="_blank">construction of an 8bit CPU</a>, based on the book Digital Computer Electronics by A. Malvino - this further consolidated my admiration for hardware/systems projects within the Computer Science field.

      Once I finished college I got into Loughborough University, studying Computer Science and Business Management (BSc). I graduated with a 2:1 last summer.

    <p>
      During my time there I was part of two societies, one of them being a <a href="https://loughborough.nightline.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Nightline,</a> student to student listening service. This really opened my eyes to the importance of mental health and introduced me to a wonderful world of acceptance, respect and love.

    <p>
      The other society was <a href="https://lumotorsport.com/" target="_blank">LUMotorsport</a>, a university team competing internationally against other universities to build and race a single seat race car. My university's final year project was based around the <a href="fyp.pdf" target="_blank">creation of a series of low-cost data-centered projects for the team's journey from a combustion car to an electric one.</a>

    That's about it for now. When I do more cool stuff I'll make sure to write it here! <br><br>
    Psst, psst - <a href="cv.pdf" target="_blank">here is my CV</a> just in case. You can reach me at <b>me@carloslagoa.com</b>
