      I am 21 and from Spain. Even though I was born in Barcelona, I have lived in Mallorca for most of my life.  <br>

      Some close people to me were commercial pilots, and as such I've always liked aviation. At around 16 or so I really started liking the computer-science-ey side of planes; avionics and by extension embedded systems.

      When I was 15 I moved to the UK for college. It was really cool to leave my home country and discover a new part of the world.

      In college I got into Arch Linux, ThinkPads (and how cool toying with computers is) and Python, which I used on my Computer Science Project; making a <a href="coursework.pdf" target="_blank">2D Air traffic Control game</a> (it was a bit of a trash project, but a really cool experience).

      For my last year of college I also did an Extended Project Qualification. I did mine on the <a href="epq.pdf" target="_blank">construction of an 8bit CPU</a>, based on the book Digital Computer Electronics by A. Malvino - this further consolidated my admiration for hardware/systems projects within the Computer Science field.

      Once I finished college I got into Loughborough University, studying Computer Science and Business Management (BSc) - I am about to finish (Summer 2020). During my time there I was part of two societies, one of them being a <a href="https://loughborough.nightline.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> student to student listening service</a> which really opened my eyes to the importance of mental health.

    <p>
      The other society was <a href="https://lumotorsport.com/" target="_blank">LUMotorsport</a>, a university team competing internationally against other universities to build and race a single seat race car. My dissertation was based around the <a href="fyp.pdf" target="_blank">creation of a series of low-cost data-centered projects for the team's journey from a combustion car to an electric one</a>.

    That's about it for now. When I do more cool stuff I'll make sure to write it here! <br><br>
    Psst, psst - <a href="cv.pdf" target="_blank">here is my CV</a> just in case. You can reach me at c.lagoa.p@gmail.com <i>(soon will self-host email dw)</i>
