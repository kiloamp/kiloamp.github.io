      People close to me were in commercial aviation, so since I was little I've always enjoyed aviation. At around 15 or so I also started enjoying the computer-science-ey side of planes; avionics.

      Around that time I moved to the UK for college: one of the best decisions I've ever taken. Not only did I improve my english and got to soak up a new culture, but I went through an incredible journey of self-discovery and made some great friends along the way.

      In school I got into tech; particularly toying with Linux. I did my CompSci Project on a <a href="coursework.pdf" target="_blank">2D Air Traffic Control game</a> (bit of a trash project, but a cool experience). But my fave college-time project was more low-level systems/electronics --- the <a href="epq.pdf" target="_blank">construction of an 8bit CPU</a>.

      Once I finished college I got into Loughborough University, studying Computer Science and Business Management (BSc). I graduated with a 2:1 last summer.       During my time there I was part of two societies, one of them being <a href="https://loughborough.nightline.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Nightline,</a> a student to student listening service. This really opened my eyes to the importance of mental health and introduced me to a wonderful world of acceptance, respect and listening (both to yourself and to others).

      The other society was <a href="https://lumotorsport.com/" target="_blank">LUMotorsport</a>, a Formula Student university team competing internationally against other universities to build and race a single seat race car.  My university's final year project was based around the <a href="fyp.pdf" target="_blank">creation of a series of low-cost data-centered projects for the team's journey from a combustion car to an electric one.</a> (Excuse the spelling mistakes this is the pre-correction-29hrs-sprint final draft). The final project was somewhat shortened because of COVID, but it was a rewarding way to say bye to university nonetheless.

    	Currently, I am back in Spain. Doing my EASA ATPL(A) (Airline Transport Pilot License) and hope to have it finished by early 2023! At the same time, I'm working with <a href="https://marpledata.com" target="_blank">Marple</a>, an awesome tech startup that provides visualization and analysis of time series data for engineering teams over the cloud! It's fun to be able to do both things and to switch between them.
