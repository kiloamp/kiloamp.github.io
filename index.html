      I am 21 and from Spain. Even though I was born in Barcelona, I have lived in Mallorca for most of my life.  <br>

      As some family members and close friends were commercial pilots, I was interested in planes from a young age. I always knew that I wanted to work as a pilot but as the years progressed I started liking the avionics-side of aircraft just as much as the plane itself. A plane avionics is the embedded softwre it runs on - its a realtime, single use system.

      💻 I did CompSci and Business Mgmt in university; <br>
      I love the way hardware and software join and the creative aspect of it. I also think it is madly social. You can just sit with some friends and literally redefine anything, disrupt any industry. You can have fun with it, use it to extend other jobs, practise with it... it's just great.<br> <br>
      👨‍✈️ I love aviation; <br>
      It's such a good mix of nature and science, of the complexity of putting something in the air and the simplicity of looking at the clouds and feeling like your are flying. Ideally soon I will be developing my knowledge in the field and trying to get a job in it (to some extend).

      ⚽ As a sport, I think football is great; <br>
      I don't think I enjoy any other sport more. It's just so easy to start playing with anyone - no language needed. You can play just you to literally tens of people. It trains endurance, strength, balance but also the brain, imagination and social skills.  <br><br>
      🏎️ Motorsport, what a combination; <br>
      Motorsport in a way is like 💻, 👨‍✈️ and ⚽ together. CompSci's team building approaches to create something. Aviation's perfect mix between a natural feeling ('going fast') and the science behind why it is that you can go fast. Football's combination of mental and physical development.
