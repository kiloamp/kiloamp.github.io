        <summary><b>Carlos as a human</b></summary>
         <p>
           Hello, I'm Carlos. <br>
           I am 21 (21, wow) and I'm just about to finish university. <br>
           I am from Spain, I moved to the UK for college. <br>

         <p>
           💻 I am crazy about Computer Science; <br>
           I love the way hardware and software join and the creative aspect of it. I also think it is madly social. You can just sit with some friends and literally redefine anything, disrupt any industry. You can have fun with it, use it to extend other jobs, practise with it... it's just great.<br> <br>
           👨‍✈️ I love aviation; <br>
           It's such a good mix of nature and science, of the complexity of putting something in the air and the simplicity of looking at the clouds and feeling like your are flying. Ideally soon I will be developing my knowledge in the field and trying to get a job in it (to some extend).

        <summary><b>Carlos and hobbies</b></summary>
         <p>
           ⚽ As a sport, I think football is great; <br>
           I don't think I enjoy any other sport more. It's just so easy to start playing with anyone - no language needed. You can play just you to literally tens of people. It trains endurance, strength, balance but also the brain, imagination and social skills.  <br><br>

           🏎️ Motorsport, what a combination; <br>
           Motorsport in a way is like 💻, 👨‍✈️ and ⚽ together. CompSci's team building approaches to create something. Aviation's perfect mix between a natural feeling ('going fast') and the science behind why it is that you can go fast. Football's combination of mental and physical development.

        <summary><b>Carlos as a failure</b></summary>
         <p>
           Over the past few years, but especially over the last few months (I am young still, so everything happens quickly at the moment) I have felt stagnant. <br> <br>

           Enrolled in a Computer Science course at univeristy, though not really enjoying it - in fact pushing me away from the things I enjoyed about it. Maybe a bit my fault? Maybe a bit to blame on the university's side? <br><br>

           Irregardless, I have felt unmotivated to learn anything (course related or extra curricular) and that is what matters. Furthermore, I have been stressed about the short term future in terms of jobs and "who I want to be". This has really put me in a weird spot over the last few months and with this website (and the ending of my CompSci degree) I hope to maybe create a space where I can turn to, in order to be a bit more efficient. <br> <br>

           Maybe this space being public and me timestamping every time I write on it (currently 26th March 2020 btw) gives it a more urgent look, and I choose to try to add things to it (ie, do small projects).
