      I'm Carlos, a 22 year old recently-graduated-student. I was born in Barcelona, but moved to Mallorca at a young age.<br>

      People close to me were commercial pilots, so since I was little I've always enjoyed aviation. At around 15 or so I also started enjoying the computer-science-ey side of planes; avionics.

      Around that time I moved to the UK for college: one of the best decisions I've ever taken. Not only did I improve my english and got to soak up a new culture, but I went through an incredible journey of self-discovery and made some great friends along the way.

      In college I got into Linux, ThinkPads (and how cool toying with computers is) and Python, which I used on my Computer Science Project; making a <a href="coursework.pdf" target="_blank">2D Air traffic Control game</a> (it was a bit of a trash project, but a really cool experience).

    <p>
      My favourite college-time project however, was more hardware based. It definitely sent me on a path of appreciation for more low-level electronic/systems projects and consolidated my admiration in that field.  I did mine on the <a href="epq.pdf" target="_blank">construction of an 8bit CPU</a>, based on the book Digital Computer Electronics by A. Malvino.

      Once I finished college I got into Loughborough University, studying Computer Science and Business Management (BSc). I graduated with a 2:1 last summer.

    <p>
      During my time there I was part of two societies, one of them being a <a href="https://loughborough.nightline.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Nightline,</a> student to student listening service. This really opened my eyes to the importance of mental health and introduced me to a wonderful world of acceptance, respect and listening (both to yourself and to others).

    <p>
      The other society was <a href="https://lumotorsport.com/" target="_blank">LUMotorsport</a>, a university team competing internationally against other universities to build and race a single seat race car. My university's final year project was based around the <a href="fyp.pdf" target="_blank">creation of a series of low-cost data-centered projects for the team's journey from a combustion car to an electric one.</a>

    	Currently, I am back in Spain - now in Madrid. Doing my EASA ATPL(A) (Airline Transport Pilot License) and hope to have it finished by early 2023!

    That's about it for now. When I do more cool stuff I'll make sure to write it here! <br><br>
    Psst, psst - <a href="cv.pdf" target="_blank">here is my CV</a> just in case. You can reach me at <b>me@carloslagoa.com</b>
